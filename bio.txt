# Hackathon Website Template - Project Bio

## Overview
The Hackathon Website Template is designed to streamline the organization and management of hackathons. It provides a robust platform for event organizers to manage participants, schedules, submissions, and judging seamlessly. This project aims to support the hackathon community by offering a user-friendly and highly customizable website template.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of this project is to offer a ready-to-use, customizable website template for hackathons. It facilitates the entire process of organizing a hackathon, from registration and participant management to project submissions and final judging. By using this template, organizers can focus more on the event itself rather than the logistics of setting up a website.

- **TailwindCSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for styling the website.
- **Figma:** Used for designing the website interface.
- **ESLint & Prettier:** Tools for code quality and formatting.
- **GitHub Actions:** CI/CD for automated testing and deployment.
- **Cypress:** End-to-end testing framework to ensure functionality.
